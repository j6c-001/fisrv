FIS Race Visualizer.
* In the world of cross country skiing many races are time trial or individual start format. Watching these events can be frustrating because it is hard to tell where the racers stand with respect to the pack. The aim of this application is to provide a way to replay a race using a simplified visual representation where you can see full race timing information as well the state of the race.  Additionally, if it exists, the race can be paired and synchronized with a youtube video of the race.
* Application works by downloads timing splits for a designated FIS nordic race . Using this data, topographical data are estimated, and a visual representation of the course is generated.
